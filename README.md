# 1st internship project

<p>
  Project of the first internship. It is a online book store with an admin page. Admin is responsible for adding books to the collection. To run this application, just download XAMPP and run MySQL and Apache. The operation system used for this is Windows, so in the folder you have saved XAMPP, open the 'htdocs', create a new file (you can name it however you want) and put the code in there. Then, just navigate in your browser <br/><br/>
  https://localhost/your-folder/page.php
</p>
<p>
  You can also set this in the configuration files to open automatically.
